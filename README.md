# Hello world! (get it..?)

Iâ€™m Raphael, a computer science student at drexel university passionate about software development and how creativity connects with code.

Right now iâ€™m building projects that make learning tech more fun and approachable, like tutorial scout and codeconnect, while also following random bursts of curiosity through smaller experiments and side projects.

When iâ€™m not debugging or sketching ui ideas, youâ€™ll probably find me reading, tinkering with new tools, or exploring a new coffee shop.
